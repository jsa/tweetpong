I did this very quick and dirty hack to get tweets to png. Mainly motivated
by the Github wiki's restrictions of what can be embedded there.

But it works, check it out: http://tweetpong.appspot.com/23019320509.png

Replace the id on the url with any tweet id and (if you're lucky) you'll get
a nice png.
